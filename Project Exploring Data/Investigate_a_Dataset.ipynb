    "### Dataset Description \n",
    "This Dataset is provided by Kaggle.com under the title \"Medical Appointment No Shows: Why do 30% of patients miss their scheduled appointments?\". This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the  question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. Columns in this Dataset include:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>The patient and appointment ID</li>\n",
    "    <li>The gendre of the patient</li>\n",
    "    <li>The age of the patient</li>\n",
    "    <li>The time for scheduling the appointment as well as the appointment time itself</li> \n",
    "    <li>The hospital neighbourhood</li>\n",
    "    <li>If they are part of a Brasilian welfare program called Bolsa Fam√≠lia</li>\n",
    "    <li>the different ailments the patient might suffer from which include:\n",
    "        <ul>\n",
    "        <li>Diabates</li>\n",
    "        <li>Hypertension</li>\n",
    "        <li>Alcohlism</li>\n",
    "        <li>Handicap</li>\n",
    "        </ul>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>If they got an SMS to remind them of the appointment</li>\n",
    "    <li>And of course, finally, whether they showed up at the appointment or not</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "Some interesting questions can be posed about this dataset and those will be discussed in the follwing section.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question(s) for Analysis\n",
    "Before questions can be asked, one must identify the independant variables and the dependant ones. Of course, the dependant variable for this set would be the \"show/no-show\" data because that is what is being questioned and that is the variable that may change depending on other variables. The independant variables would be every other variable in the data set.  \n",
    "With that done, it is now possible to ask questions about why a patient might not show up to their appointment.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Some questions that can be asked are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Does gender affect whether or not the patient shows up</li>\n",
    "    <li>Does age affect if they apply for welfare</li>\n",
    "    <li>Does a person with a handicap have a higher chance of missing their appointment</li>\n",
    "    <li>Will a person reminded by SMS still miss their appointment</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the questions are defined, importing the data and cleaning it depending on the needed variables, can be carried out."

I have tried to fix it with the commented out code (taken from <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71369078/init-got-an-unexpected-keyword-argument-max-rows>this</a> stack overflow page) above the df definition but it didn't make much of a difference so I commented it out again. the error seems to be a warning more than it is an error, meaning that it doesn't stop the code from running and functioning as it should.

    "We did a quick analysis of the dataset to see if we had any missing values, duplicated rows or wrong data types. Fortunately, the data set had no missing values nor duplicated rows and all the variables we will work with have the correct data type. Then we had to drop the unnecessary columns from our dataframe. These were the data we did not need in our questions. This included the patient and appointment IDs as they were only specific to the user themselves rather than helping in answering our questions. The appointment and scheduled dates were not needed either because our scope does not depend on the dates/durations between scheduled and appointment dates. Finally, we dropped the hospital neighbourhood column as well because we do not care where the hospital is situated for this analysis. Next, we will rename the columns to have a lower case name and underscores, where appropriate, to make the naming used consistent and easy.\n",

Most of the analysis had to be done using proportions and that doesn't give as much of an accurate result as comparing values right away. comparing 2 percentages together, especially when one signifies a very small amount and the other a very large one, could create unfair comparisons seeing that the smaller variables can fluctuate their percentages much greater than the bigger ones at the slihtest value changes.\n",
