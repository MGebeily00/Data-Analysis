# Data-Analysis

The US Bikeshare folder: In this project, Python was used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. A code was written to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. A script was also written that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

The Exploring data folder contains a csv file of no show doctor appointments and the task was to perform variuos data analysis inquiries to further undestand and study the data. In this project, an analysis of the dataset was carried out and then findings about it were communicated. The Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib were used to make the analysis easier.
